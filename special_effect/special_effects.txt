Heightmap:

The heightmap uses a plane with several vertexes. This vertices are maniplulated with the heightmap.
To get these we use the function getHeight(a_texCoord); For a better texturing we use a ratio to 
get a smoother surface. For the lighting of the surface we using als components of the heightmap
and calculate with these componets a offset, which we set to the eyePosition.
