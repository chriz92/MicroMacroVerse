Heightmap:

We use a plane with several vertexes. These vertices are maniplulated by the heightmap shader.
In the shader we get the color of the heightmap texture and use the red channel value as height.
We then apply a mulitplier and a bias to get the height range of [-0.25, 0.25].
All of this is happening inside a function called getHeight.
To calculate the normal of the current vertex, we get it's neighbouring pixels height.
In the fragment shader we apply the texture and lighting.
